This is a README. Its purpose is to be read. Unfortunately, it has nothing
good to say, because I used all my creative energy naming variables.

I love rubber duckies.

“Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer’s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.”
- Grady Booch author of Object
Oriented Analysis and Design with
Applications

Rubber duckies will one day rule this world!
